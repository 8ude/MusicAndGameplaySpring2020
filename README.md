## Week 1 Assignment -- Sound Toy Prototype 1

Due In-Class Monday Feb 3

Create some kind of digital sound toy in Unity.  I have provided an example project for you, called SoundToyBasic (start with the scene called "BouncingBalls").  

At a minimum, replace all of the audio in the experience by changing the **PlatformBounce** component in the **2dBouncePlatformModel prefab** (see [this screenshot for reference](imgur.com/a/5ZPlU6I)), and change up the visuals.  

I encourage you to do more extreme alterations of the project, or start from scratch!
