# MusicAndGameplaySpring2020
2020 version of the Music and Gameplay Class

## General Note : Late and Absent Submissions

If you are absent for a class, or are turning in an assignment late, please upload the following:

A build of the game for Windows PC (make sure you build your game into a new folder, and zip the entire contents!  Otherwise your game won't run).

A short (30 second - 1 minute) playthrough video showing typical gameplay.  I recommend using [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)

Upload these in the appropriate sub folder at [THIS LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_uvt8mfxMRaz2n0_utDQjMEBZICB_bfL?usp=sharing)

Label them as YourName_YourProjectName

## Week 3 Assignment -- Last Sound Toy Prototype

Due In-Class Monday Feb 24

Try to go in a different direction with this last sound toy prototype - maybe use a different control surface (for example, you can get input from a MIDI controller using Kejiro Takahashi's MIDIJack: https://github.com/keijiro/MidiJack), do something that plays with timing and rhythm, and get away from bouncing balls.

In addition to presenting these in class, please upload a **Windows Build** in [THIS FOLDER](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13tJg8sUqce9CbYxbcsW66ymdj2j2UpV8)   

## Week 2 Assignment -- Sound Toy Prototype 2

Due In-Class Monday Feb 10

You can either expand on your original sound toy prototype, or go off in a different direction.  If you choose the latter, I recommend experimenting with synthesis in Unity, using the SynthBounce scene, or building off the [example repo from pixlpa](https://github.com/pixlpa/Unity-Synth-Experiments).

## Week 1 Assignment -- Sound Toy Prototype 1

Due In-Class Monday Feb 3

Create some kind of digital sound toy in Unity.  I have provided an example project for you, called SoundToyBasic (start with the scene called "BouncingBalls").  

At a minimum, replace all of the audio in the experience by changing the **PlatformBounce** component in the **2dBouncePlatformModel prefab** (see [this screenshot for reference](https://imgur.com/a/5ZPlU6I)), and change up the visuals.  

I encourage you to do more extreme alterations of the project, or start from scratch!
