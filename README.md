# MusicAndGameplaySpring2020
2020 version of the Music and Gameplay Class

## General Note : Late and Absent Submissions

If you are absent for a class, or are turning in an assignment late, please upload the following:

A build of the game for Windows PC (make sure you build your game into a new folder, and zip the entire contents!  Otherwise your game won't run).

A short (30 second - 1 minute) playthrough video showing typical gameplay.  I recommend using [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)

Upload these in the appropriate sub folder at [THIS LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_uvt8mfxMRaz2n0_utDQjMEBZICB_bfL?usp=sharing)

Label them as YourName_YourProjectName

## Week 6 Assignment -- Rhythm Game Prototype 2

Due In-Class Monday March 9

Revise your Rhythm Game, now using a MIDI file for your beatmap (follow [THIS TUTORIAL]() if you need a refresher)

Particular areas to explore:

 - Art/Theming - Add particles, trail effects, or sprites!  Change the speed, make it look pretty, get rid of the default unity skybox!

 - Revise your music - maybe extend your song to be longer, or change it up based on feedback you received during class

 - Adding reference points and changing the cues - maybe the cues make noise when they appear.  Maybe you could add another visual element that happens every beat, but isn't scored.  How could you add a musical "grid" that moves in time?

 - Animating background elements - we will explore music-driven animation in later weeks, but even some idle background animation can make the space feel much more alive.

## Week 5 Assignment -- Rhythm Game Prototype 1

Due In-Class Monday March 2

Option 1: Using the template project, make **new music** and a **beatmap** for the game.  The beatmap is essentially your level - edit this on the "Beatmap" game object.  The audio clip for the music should go on the clock script.  make sure to change the tempo to match your song.

Option 2: If you feel comfortable with coding, try making your own rhythm game.  you still need to make the music and beatmap, but maybe you change the inputs, the feedback, or the theming (instead of falling sphere's, use a different cue/input system)

## Week 3 Assignment -- Last Sound Toy Prototype

Due In-Class Monday Feb 24

Try to go in a different direction with this last sound toy prototype - maybe use a different control surface (for example, you can get input from a MIDI controller using Kejiro Takahashi's MIDIJack: https://github.com/keijiro/MidiJack), do something that plays with timing and rhythm, and get away from bouncing balls.

In addition to presenting these in class, please upload a **Windows Build** in [THIS FOLDER](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13tJg8sUqce9CbYxbcsW66ymdj2j2UpV8)   

## Week 2 Assignment -- Sound Toy Prototype 2

Due In-Class Monday Feb 10

You can either expand on your original sound toy prototype, or go off in a different direction.  If you choose the latter, I recommend experimenting with synthesis in Unity, using the SynthBounce scene, or building off the [example repo from pixlpa](https://github.com/pixlpa/Unity-Synth-Experiments).

## Week 1 Assignment -- Sound Toy Prototype 1

Due In-Class Monday Feb 3

Create some kind of digital sound toy in Unity.  I have provided an example project for you, called SoundToyBasic (start with the scene called "BouncingBalls").  

At a minimum, replace all of the audio in the experience by changing the **PlatformBounce** component in the **2dBouncePlatformModel prefab** (see [this screenshot for reference](https://imgur.com/a/5ZPlU6I)), and change up the visuals.  

I encourage you to do more extreme alterations of the project, or start from scratch!
