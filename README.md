# MusicAndGameplaySpring2020
2020 version of the Music and Gameplay Class

## General Note : New Remote Classroom Procedures

As of March 23, we now have a revised syllabus, with updated classroom locations and schedule.

NYU is now fully remote, which means the bulk of our instructions is going to take place over zoom.  Class will be held at the following links:

[Monday Class (10 am - 12:45 pm EST)](https://nyu.zoom.us/j/290850168)

[Thursday Office Hours (10 am - noon EST](https://nyu.zoom.us/j/899290917)

I'm also starting up virtual coworking time, basically an even more informal version of office hours, where I will screenshare my own work on class examples and rhythm games.  

[Mondays and Thursdays (2 pm - 4 pm EST)](https://nyu.zoom.us/j/321870333)

If you're looking for assignment submission instructions, that's now on a **[Wiki page over here](https://github.com/8ude/MusicAndGameplaySpring2020/wiki/Assignment-Submission-Instructions)**

## Week 7 (March 23)

Assignment: Have a playable prototype version of your midterm game ready by **Monday March 30**.  We will do brief group critiques in breakout rooms, and I will be checking progress.

Also watch Fantasia, Fantasia 2000, or Allegro Non Troppo

Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 are both available on Disney Plus.  Disney Plus has a free 7 day trial, and is about $7 a month after that.

Allegro Non Troppo is not available to stream through legal means, but a quick google search for "Allegro Non Troppo Watch Online" gives a couple of links that I can't officially endorse.  The film is like a Monty Python version of Fantasia - it would probably be rated PG-13 today.

Both Classic Fantasia and Allegro Non Troppo come with a Content Warning for nudity (in Fantasia it's pretty mild, Allegro is more raunchy).
If you want to skip this in Fantasia, it's between 1:18:00-1:33:00, and again from 1:55:00-1:58:00 

## Midterm Assignment -- Make a Music Game!

DUE: **~~March 30~~** **April 6**

![RhythmHeaven](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6278122/76261433-56a7a100-6230-11ea-8291-0ea4f9cc3f31.gif)

Working alone or in groups of 2-3, make a music game proof of concept (basically a more evolved prototype).  You can use one of your prototypes as a starting point, if you wish, but I encourage you to branch out or start over with a new concept.

[Here's a link to a rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lUFDX3V7PwgEINvMLPGwZgYD2T9u1Ucqciu40XX0Od4/edit?usp=sharing)

We will be doing a **Check-In on March 23 or March 30** that I will grade Pass/Partial/Fail, worth 20 points (20% of your midterm grade).  Iâ€™m looking for something playable!  As always, if you are absent, please upload some gameplay footage to the appropriate [Student Submissions Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_uvt8mfxMRaz2n0_utDQjMEBZICB_bfL?usp=sharing)

## Week 6 Assignment -- Rhythm Game Prototype 2

Due In-Class Monday March 9

Revise your Rhythm Game, now using a MIDI file for your beatmap (follow [THIS TUTORIAL](https://github.com/8ude/MusicAndGameplaySpring2020/wiki/Rhythm-Game-MIDI-Beatmap-Tutorial) if you need a refresher)

Particular areas to explore:

 - Art/Theming - Add particles, trail effects, or sprites!  Change the speed, make it look pretty, get rid of the default unity skybox!

 - Revise your music - maybe extend your song to be longer, or change it up based on feedback you received during class

 - Adding reference points and changing the cues - maybe the cues make noise when they appear.  Maybe you could add another visual element that happens every beat, but isn't scored.  How could you add a musical "grid" that moves in time?

 - Animating background elements - we will explore music-driven animation in later weeks, but even some idle background animation can make the space feel much more alive.

## Week 5 Assignment -- Rhythm Game Prototype 1

Due In-Class Monday March 2

Option 1: Using the template project, make **new music** and a **beatmap** for the game.  The beatmap is essentially your level - edit this on the "Beatmap" game object.  The audio clip for the music should go on the clock script.  make sure to change the tempo to match your song.

Option 2: If you feel comfortable with coding, try making your own rhythm game.  you still need to make the music and beatmap, but maybe you change the inputs, the feedback, or the theming (instead of falling sphere's, use a different cue/input system)

## Week 3 Assignment -- Last Sound Toy Prototype

Due In-Class Monday Feb 24

Try to go in a different direction with this last sound toy prototype - maybe use a different control surface (for example, you can get input from a MIDI controller using Kejiro Takahashi's MIDIJack: https://github.com/keijiro/MidiJack), do something that plays with timing and rhythm, and get away from bouncing balls.

In addition to presenting these in class, please upload a **Windows Build** in [THIS FOLDER](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13tJg8sUqce9CbYxbcsW66ymdj2j2UpV8)   

## Week 2 Assignment -- Sound Toy Prototype 2

Due In-Class Monday Feb 10

You can either expand on your original sound toy prototype, or go off in a different direction.  If you choose the latter, I recommend experimenting with synthesis in Unity, using the SynthBounce scene, or building off the [example repo from pixlpa](https://github.com/pixlpa/Unity-Synth-Experiments).

## Week 1 Assignment -- Sound Toy Prototype 1

Due In-Class Monday Feb 3

Create some kind of digital sound toy in Unity.  I have provided an example project for you, called SoundToyBasic (start with the scene called "BouncingBalls").  

At a minimum, replace all of the audio in the experience by changing the **PlatformBounce** component in the **2dBouncePlatformModel prefab** (see [this screenshot for reference](https://imgur.com/a/5ZPlU6I)), and change up the visuals.  

I encourage you to do more extreme alterations of the project, or start from scratch!
